* fix increments in major_collection_step() in the phases
  STATE_MARKING, STATE_SWEEPING_RAWMALLOC, STATE_SWEEPING_ARENA,
  and probably STATE_FINALIZING

* 'next_major_collection_*' need to be tweaked

* check the 'reserving_size' argument here and there

* maybe make incremental: dealing with old_objects_with_weakrefs
  and old_objects_with_light_finalizers and
  deal_with_objects_with_finalizers()

* REDO external_malloc(): if somebody calls this function a lot, we must
  eventually force a full collection.

* REDO card marking, starting with "card_page_indices": 128 in
  TRANSLATION_PARAMS

* write barrier: avoid the case when during sweeping we have GCFLAG_VISITED
  on an object, so we call the slow path, but the slow path doesn't do
  anything, and we still have GCFLAG_VISITED so we will keep calling it
  on the same object
