* fix increments in major_collection_step() in the phases
  STATE_MARKING, STATE_SWEEPING_RAWMALLOC, STATE_SWEEPING_ARENA,
  and probably STATE_FINALIZING

* 'next_major_collection_*' need to be tweaked

* check the 'reserving_size' argument here and there

* maybe make incremental: dealing with old_objects_with_weakrefs
  and old_objects_with_light_finalizers and
  deal_with_objects_with_finalizers()

* REDO external_malloc(): if somebody calls this function a lot, we must
  eventually force a full collection.
