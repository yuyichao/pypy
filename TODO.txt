==================================

- why do we need to implement array.nonzero on this branch and it was not done
  e.g. on default?

- def get_shape_and_dtype(space, nd, dims, typenum):
    shape = []
    for i in range(nd):
        # back-and-forth wrapping needed to translate
        shape.append(space.int_w(space.wrap(dims[i])))

  this looks very strange: we should probably do a proper rpython cast instead
  of doing this strange wrap/unwrap dance

- interp_numarray.py :: descr___array__: the dtype method is ignored: it's
  fine to have a half-working implementation, but it should raise an exception
  if it's passed

TODO list by mattip
===================

- test array.nonzero()
- test "from numpypy import *" esp. get_include()
- test "import numpy" emitting warning not error
- test all *.h files under pypy/module/cpyext/include/numpy
- make sure all cpyext changes are tested:
    PyBoolObject (new)
    PyComplexFromCComplex() (changed, problematic for c++?)
    PyFunctionType (new)
    PyMethodType (new)
    PyRangeType (new)
    PyTracebackType (new)
    _PyPackageContext (new)
    Py*Flag (most new, some changed) in pythonrun.h
    all ndarrayobject.c
    copy_header_files() in api.py (changed)
    all ndarrayobject.py (new)
    PyNumberCoerceEx() (new)
    PyNumberCoerce() (new)
- test require_index in create_iter, get_index in iter
- test use of __array__() and friends
