==================================

- why do we need to implement array.nonzero on this branch and it was not done
  e.g. on default?

TODO list by mattip
===================

- test "from numpypy import *" esp. get_include()
- test all *.h files under pypy/module/cpyext/include/numpy
- make sure all cpyext changes are tested:
    PyBoolObject (new)
    PyComplexFromCComplex() (changed, problematic for c++?)
    PyFunctionType (new)
    PyMethodType (new)
    PyRangeType (new)
    PyTracebackType (new)
    _PyPackageContext (new)
    Py*Flag (most new, some changed) in pythonrun.h
    all ndarrayobject.c
    copy_header_files() in api.py (changed)
    all ndarrayobject.py (new)
    PyNumberCoerceEx() (new)
    PyNumberCoerce() (new)
- test, implement use of __array_prepare__()
- test, implement use of __array_wrap__()
