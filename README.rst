PyPy: Python in Python Implementation 
=====================================

Welcome to PyPy!

PyPy is both an implementation of the Python programming language, and
an extensive compiler framework for dynamic language implementations.
You can build self-contained Python implementations which execute
independently from CPython.

The home page is:

If you want to help developing PyPy, this document might help you:

    http://doc.pypy.org/

It will also point you to the rest of the documentation which is generated
from files in the pypy/doc directory within the source repositories. Enjoy
and send us feedback!
